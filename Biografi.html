					<b>About Me</b>
					<br><p>Hello, I'm Daniel, a 25-year-old design student with a passion for creativity and a keen eye for aesthetics. Design has always been my calling, and I've embarked on an exciting journey to hone my skills and channel my imagination into visual and interactive experiences.</p><br>
					<b>My Journey</b>
					<br><p>I've always been drawn to the world of design. From an early age, I found myself captivated by the power of visuals to convey ideas, emotions, and stories. This fascination led me to pursue a degree in Design at EA-Dania, where I am currently in my 1st year.</p><br>
					<b>Areas of Expertise</b>
					<br><p>My journey in design has allowed me to explore various facets of the field, including graphic design, web design, UX/UI design, and even a bit of 3D modeling. I'm a firm believer that design is not just about making things look pretty; it's about solving problems, enhancing functionality, and creating experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p><br>
					<b>Passion and Vision</b>
					<br><p>I see design as a medium to connect with people, and my mission is to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality. I strive to create designs that not only catch the eye but also provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience. From crafting stunning visuals to developing user-friendly interfaces, my work is a reflection of my dedication to these principles.</p><br>
					<b>Current Projects</b>
					<br><p>As a design student, I'm constantly immersed in creative projects. Whether it's designing a captivating website, working on branding and identity, or experimenting with the latest design tools and techniques, I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. You can explore some of my latest projects in my portfolio.</p><br>
					<b>Future Aspirations</b>
					<br><p>Looking ahead, my goal is to continue my education and expand my knowledge in design. I'm excited about the ever-evolving nature of the field and the possibilities it holds. I'm also open to collaboration and real-world projects that allow me to apply my skills and contribute to the design community.</p><br>
